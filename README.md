 A super-basic breakout-style game in javascript / HTML5
 The first program I wrote (typed) was a breakout game from a manual
 for a Timex Sinclair 1000, this kinda brings me back. This program
 is much shorter as the one for the Sinclair was in BASIC.
 Nothing fancy, just an excercise. I started from
 a demo of a bouncing ball [http://cssdeck.com/labs/lets-make-a-bouncing-ball-in-html5-canvas]
 and decided to make a basic breakout.
 Just a fun project I like to work on when I'm burned out from work.
 TODO:
     Pad needs to be an object.
     Blocks needs to be an object.
     Speed needs to increment on level or bounce (haven't decided)
     When you get rid of all the blocks nothing happens, need
         to add levels
     Ball doesn't contact block until the center of the block touches
         the block. Need to make the radius affect block collisions
     Add levels of different sized/colors blocks
     Maybe add a score or something
