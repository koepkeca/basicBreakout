 A super-basic breakout-style game in javascript / HTML5 <br/>
 The first program I wrote (typed) was a breakout game from a manual <br/>
 for a Timex Sinclair 1000, this kinda brings me back. This program <br/>
 is much shorter as the one for the Sinclair was in BASIC. <br/>
 Nothing fancy, just an excercise. I started from <br/>
 a demo of a bouncing ball [http://cssdeck.com/labs/lets-make-a-bouncing-ball-in-html5-canvas] <br/>
 and decided to make a basic breakout. <br/>
 Just a fun project I like to work on when I'm burned out from work. <br/>
 TODO: <br/>
     <li>Pad needs to be an object.</li>
     <li>Blocks needs to be an object.</li>
     <li>Speed needs to increment on level or bounce (haven't decided)</li>
     <li>When you get rid of all the blocks nothing happens, need
         to add levels</li>
     <li>Ball doesn't contact block until the center of the block touches
         the block. Need to make the radius affect block collisions</li>
     <li>Add levels of different sized/colors blocks</li>
     <li>Maybe add a score or something</li>
